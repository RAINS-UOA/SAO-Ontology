<span class="markdown">
The System Accountability Ontology (SAO) is a generic, reusable, lightweight core ontology which introduces a set of concepts to model accountability plans and their corresponding traces to support accountability of computational systems. SAO introduces sao:AccountableObject to model an abstract representation of any meaningful grouping (software component, dataset, model, evaluation process, etc.) that may be used to organise system-related accountability information.
